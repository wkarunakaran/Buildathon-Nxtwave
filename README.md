 KAN EZHUTHU AN AI Integrated Learning System for Visually & Hearing Impaired People with Braille and Sign Language

"Empowering Every Touch, Enabling Every Voice."

Kan Ezhuthu is an AI-integrated assistive learning system designed for both visually impaired and hearing-impaired students.
It simplifies education through:

👆 Touch-based Braille learning
🎙️ Voice interaction
✋ Sign Language recognition & animation
🤖 GenAI-powered content generation
📚 Personalized adaptive learning modules

This project bridges the education gap by providing affordable, interactive, and intelligent learning solutions in regional languages.

🎨 AI-assisted sign animation generation
💡 Adaptive learning recommendations
🏫 Why Kan Ezhuthu? (Motivation)


Millions of visually or hearing-impaired individuals struggle to learn due to:
❌ Lack of accessible Braille content
❌ High cost of assistive tools
❌ Limited regional language support
❌ No personalized learning
❌ Minimal interactive tools
❌ Dependency on teachers or caretakers


Kan Ezhuthu solves these using AI + hardware and offers a low-cost, scalable, inclusive education system.
